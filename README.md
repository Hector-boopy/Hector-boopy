Hello, I'm an aspiring developer looking to learn how to create meaningful code, or silly fun code depending on my mood. 

I'm a student at the school Epitech following the cursus MSc Pro, and right now I'm looking for an appenticeship.

I don't really know what to put in there, so here comes some random stuff about me. Read it or don't, whatever suits you :

- I have a degree in chemistry, but it never came to my help because everyone seems to want a junior with 2000 years of experience to make basic tests and chemist stuff because logic
- I used to work at pizzerias a lot, so I can make tasty pizzas
- I tried working at a factory at Merck Molsheim, didn't really liked it
- I decided to learn code because in my search for something, it has been the only constant and it's fun learning how the things I use all the time actually work

Right now, I'm still discovering the many faces of programming. I'm interested in cybersecurity, and recently found another big interest in app dev, specifically with Angular which I think looks cool. I also want to check out Unity and C# for video games dev (duh), but also for UX because I think it has a lot of potential. My problem right now is actually focusing on one aspect, there is so much things to learn and it feels kinda onverwhelming.

Hello, I'm an aspiring developer looking to learn how to create meaningful code, or silly fun code depending on my mood. 

I'm a student at the school Epitech following the cursus MSc Pro, and right now I'm looking for an appenticeship.

I don't really know what to put in there, so here comes some random stuff about me. Read it or don't, whatever suits you :

- I have a degree in chemistry, but it never came to my help because everyone seems to want a junior with 2000 years of experience to make basic tests and chemist stuff because logic.
- I used to work at pizzerias a lot, so I can make tasty pizzas.
- I tried working at a factory at Merck Molsheim, didn't really liked it.
- I decided to learn code because in my search for something, it has been the only constant and it's fun learning how the things I use all the time actually work.

Right now, I'm still discovering the many faces of programming. I'm mostly interested in cybersecurity because it would allow me to wear a colored hat and legally mess with people, I also like web development because of a desire to create pretty stuff that I never mustered the courage to actually pursue, and I also like augmented reality because it sounds cool as fuck.

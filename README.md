Hello, I'm an aspiring developer looking to learn how to create meaningful code, or silly fun code depending on my mood. 

I'm a student at the school Epitech following the cursus MSc Pro, and right now I'm looking for an appenticeship.

I don't really know what to put in there, so here comes some random stuff about me. Read it or don't, whatever suits you :

- I have a degree in chemistry, but it never came to my help because everyone seems to want a junior with 2000 years of experience to make basic tests and chemist stuff because logic.
- I used to work at pizzerias a lot, so I can make tasty pizzas.
- I tried working at a factory at Merck Molsheim, didn't really liked it.
- I decided to learn code because in my search for something, it has been the only constant and it's fun learning how the things I use all the time actually work.

And right now, the thing that interest me the most in coding is augmented reality. Mostly because of the potential in education and marketing, and also because it's cool as fuck. 
I still don't have anything to show for it, but I'm working on it. Maybe when RA finally start trending, I will be at the spear head tripping all over the place and making stuff appear on your screen.

Hello, I'm an aspiring developer looking to learn how to create meaningful code, or silly fun code depending on my mood. 

I'm a student at the school Epitech following the cursus MSc Pro, and right now I'm looking for an appenticeship.

I don't really know what to put in there, so here comes some random stuff about me. Read it or don't, whatever suits you :

- I have a degree in chemistry, but it never came to my help because everyone seems to want a junior with 2000 years of experience to make basic tests and chemist stuff because logic
- I used to work at pizzerias a lot, so I can make tasty pizzas
- I tried working at a factory at Merck Molsheim, didn't really liked it
- I decided to learn code because in my search for something, it has been the only constant and it's fun learning how the things I use all the time actually work

After a while of learning, I know now most of the basics about programming. My favorite thing is web developper, but I also enjoy learning more about network (mainly on TryHackMe) and I plan to learn some things about XR and AI. I'm still learning tho, as there are a shit ton of stuff to study with basically a million applications possible with coding, so I guess this is an endless learning process which is the thing I love the most about programming.
